00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,380
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,600
In this part we are going to have a closer look which stitch types Ink/Stitch is able to perform.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,900
We will not explain the stitch types in general, but only how to create them in Ink/Stitch.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,720
Ink/Stitch stitch types can be roughly divided into three sections: stroke, satin and fill.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,060
Here is a complete list, so you can quickly navigate to the stitch type you are interested in.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,940
This is the tutorial about fill stitches.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,560
Fill stitch is used to fill big areas with a color.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Ink/Stitch comes with two fill stitch types: manual and auto-fill.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,480
We will not show manual fill in this tutorial.

10
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,380
If you are interested in it, you can read more on our website.

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,540
Auto-fill is the default method for generating fill stitches.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,940
Create a path with a fill color.

13
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,820
Shapes can also have holes, but should not consist of more than one section.

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,700
If you need to fill a shape like the one on the right side, hit Ctrl+Shift+K to treat it as two seperate shapes.

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,220
Open the params dialogue and enable "Automatically routed fill stitching".

16
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:53,000
Set the stitch angle, while 0 is horizontal. You can also use negative values.

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:02,120
Expand the shape before stitching. This compensates the pull effect and helps to avoid gaps between sections.

18
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,640
Define the maximum fill stitch length. Stitches may be shorter at the end or start of a row.

19
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,060
Set spacing between rows - and running stitch length.

20
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,300
With "Skip last stitch in each row" you will save a hugh amount of stitches.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,060
The last stitch in each row is quite close to the first stitch in the next row.

22
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,520
Skipping it decreases stitch count and density.

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,700
Influence the output with the last setting;

24
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,480
where you define, how many rows apart stitches will fall into the same column position.

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,020
Fill stitch areas also need an underlay.

26
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,400
Switch to the "AutoFill Underlay" tab and enable "Underlay".

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,780
Here you will find  the "Fill angle" setting again.

28
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,620
By default it will be shifted for + 90 deg to the fill stitch.

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,480
Prevent underlay from showing around the outside of the fill with "inset".

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,040
Define "max. stitch length" and "row spacing", wich defaults to 3x the spacing of the top layer.

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,160
In embroidery files you want to plan where stitching starts and ends.

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,320
You can control the start and end position of a fill with visual commands.

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,440
If you cannot follow the steps shown here, follow our visual commands tutorial.

34
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
We hope you enjoyed this tutorial.
