00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,200
Ink/Stitch is an open source machine embroidery design platform based on Inkscape.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,940
Our goal is to be approachable for hobbyists while also providing the power needed by professional digitizers.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,340
In this tutorial series we are going through all important functions of Ink/Stitch.

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,580
For each tutorial you will see the Ink/Stitch version used while recording.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,820
If you are using an other version of Ink/Stitch there might be some differences within the interface and functionality.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:49,240
In this case, we would appreciate if you would contact us through our github repository, so we can update the video for you.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,980
Also if things are going too fast or are not

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,260
understandable for whatever reason,

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,200
file an issue on github -

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,140
because only then we can improve the video when it needs an update for a newer Ink/Stitch version.

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,300
We will try to keep the videos up to date

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,220
which sometimes is not an easy task

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,460
since ink stitch is a very active project

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,200
this will mean that some videos will be disappearing as it is not possible to keep the

16
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,420
same URL for updated videos.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,520
We recommend to link to the tutorial playlist and not to the specific videos directly.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,620
The videos are not trying to teach digitizing for embroidery itself. There are much better resources for this

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,140
These videos are meant to explain the Ink/Stitch way of creating embroidery files.

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,420
If you don't know Inkscape, you might want to learn their basics first

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,020
In these tutorials we often use shortcut keys.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,660
In the bottom right corner you will see in most videos a keyboard indicator.

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,780
Be aware that some shortcut keys are individually set in the customize tutorial.

24
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,309
Shortcut key combinations not mentioned in this video are native shortcut keys from Inkscape and can be used without any customization.

25
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,549
Whenever you have questions or remarks you are welcome on GitHub to discuss your issue.

26
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,969
We have a section on our homepage were you could publish your Ink/Stitch created designs.

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,900
We are very curious to see, what you will create.

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Have fun with this tutorial series.

29
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,060
We hope it will make it easy for you to express your creativity in stitched out designs.
