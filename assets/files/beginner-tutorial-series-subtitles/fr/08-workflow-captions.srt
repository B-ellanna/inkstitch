00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,060
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,880
In this part we are going to have a look at the Ink/Stitch workflow.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,760
It includes the following steps, without being too strongly attached to this exact order.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Quiet a few of the shortcut keys used in this tutorial are customly set.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,200
Watch the customize video to learn how to establish them.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
The first thing to do is to create a vector image.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:40,040
You could also use existing images. If you have an PNG-image you could even trace it through 'Path > Trace Bitmap'.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,720
For a brief demonstration we will create the image by ourselves.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,940
To create lines you can either use the pencil tool, which can be activated with 'P'

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,620
- or the beziÃ©r tool enabled with 'B'.

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,300
You can also use shapes such as the square or the circle.

12
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:33,000
Convert them to a path with 'Shift + Control + C' or the corresponding symbol in node editor mode.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,540
Fill bounded areas with help of the fill tool. The shortcut key for this is 'U'.

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,500
If you installed the Addons you will have color palettes available.

15
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,440
Set the fill color by clicking on them. The stroke color can be change with 'Shift + Click'.

16
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,960
Now that the image is done, you should save a copy into an other layer and hide the first one (we skipped this step here).

17
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,200
The next step will be to convert the lines in such way, that Ink/Stitch will understand how it should be sewn out.

18
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,880
At this point we assume that you know how to create satin columns, fills and running stitches.

19
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,680
If not, have a look at the corresponding videos.

20
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,400
Set the params as you like and don't forget to use underlay.

21
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Plan your stitch order carefully.

22
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,500
It will have a lot of impact on the quality of your design.

23
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,960
While planning the stitch order you try to avoid jump stitches and also color changes.

24
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,520
You don't want to change colors all the time while stitching out the design.

25
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Run the simulator to see if you might need to adjust the direction of some objects.

26
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,260
You can also see the direction through the red sparks when in node editor mode.

27
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,860
We have explained them in the customize video.

28
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,540
Change the direction through `Path > Reverse` or use a custom shortcut key.

29
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:37,920
Ink/Stitch will stitch objects in exactly the order they appear in your SVG document, from lowest to highest in stacking order.

30
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:45,100
If the distance between two objects is long, Ink/Stitch will add a jump-stitch between them automatically.

31
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,900
It uses the color of the object to determine thread color,

32
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,660
so changes in color from one object to the next will result in a thread-change instruction

33
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,500
being added to the embroidery output file.

34
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,140
We need to use the objects panel.

35
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,480
We recommend to make heavy use of layers and groups at this point.

36
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,580
This will help a lot while reordering objects.

37
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,620
Create a group of objects with 'Ctrl + G' and move through the objects in the desired order,

38
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,100
while pushing the next object in line to the bottom of the group.

39
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,760
Attach commands to give Ink/Stitch additional information.

40
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,320
Trims, Stops, Fill start- and ending points are just some of the options.

41
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,140
Watch our visual commands video to get more information.

42
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,280
During the whole process you were already running visualizations through the params dialogue.

43
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:10,400
Use the simulator as standalone or even the print preview to get an impression on how the design will look in the end.

44
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,380
Most of the time the simulator will do the job just fine.

45
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:21,720
But for fill stitches the print preview is very helpful, f.e. in matter of stitch length and angle.

46
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,580
Once you are satisfied with the outcome, save the file to your disk.

47
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,120
Choose the file format that your machine can read.

48
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,400
Don't forget to also save the file in the svg file format,

49
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,380
just in case you want to improve your design at a later time.

50
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Transfer the file to your machine.

51
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,580
Perform a test sew with preferably the same fabric that you are planing to use.

52
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,060
The fabric will have influence on the outcome of the design

53
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,380
in this way that you most likely will have to adjust your design here and there.

54
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,120
Follow this routine until you are happy and ready to embroider on your best piece of fabric in your house ;)
