00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,620
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,440
In this part we are going to customize Inkscape.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,020
The customizations are not mandatory,

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,660
but they will make it more comfortable working with Ink/Stitch.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,400
This tutorial will teach how to:

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,320
Install Ink/Stitch Addons for Inkscape

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,640
The Ink/Stitch Add-ons installer will add manufacturer color palettes

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,300
and Ink/Stitch specific symbols to your Inkscape installation.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,760
Define shortcut keys for fast and easy access to often used functions.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,820
Display path outlines to make the stitch direction visible.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,540
Use grids to align your pattern.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,220
Create and load templates as a basic page setup.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,960
Let's start with the Ink/Stitch Add-ons.

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:08,960
In fact these Add-ons are two files which need to be placed in specific folders of your Inkscape installation.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:17,280
Run 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Install add-ons for Inkscape' and click install.

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,940
You will have to restart Inkscape for this to have any effect.

17
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,620
Open the color palettes panel and you will find a lot of new palettes.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,920
They all start with Ink/Stitch, so you can easily recognize them.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,740
Now you can plan your design directly with your thread manufacturers color palettes.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,920
Thread names will also be displayed in the browser output so you can share it directly with your customer.

21
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,880
The second feature we will get to know better in the visual commands tutorial.

22
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:15,720
It made symbols available, which will be used to give Ink/Stitch more information about the way your design should be stitched out.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,180
Let's add e.g. an ignore symbol to one object.

24
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,020
It indicates, that this particular object should not be stitched at all.

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Create two objects

26
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
and run the simulator.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Both objects are displayed.

28
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:59,460
With one object selected go to 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Commands > Attach command to selected Objects'.

29
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,760
Enable the ignore checkbox and click on 'Apply'.

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Now run the simulator again.

31
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,460
Only one of the two objects is being shown.

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,100
There are many more options in the visual commands section, but for now we have more customizations to do.

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,700
In Ink/Stitch there are many functions which you will be frequently using.

34
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,660
You do not really want to click through the menu all the time.

35
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,960
This means you will be wanting to use keyboard shortcuts.

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,220
We will not go through all possibilities here,

37
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,600
but only show you how to setup shortcut keys, so you can add more later.

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,200
There is a list on inkstitch.org to give you further advice which key combinations you could use.

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,780
Open the Preferences through 'Edit > Preferences'.

40
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,520
Navigate to "Interface" and choose "Keyboard Shortcuts".

41
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,500
Search for "params".

42
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
You will find it under "Extensions".

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,240
Click into the field below "Shortcut" and enter "Ctrl+Shift+P".

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,440
Next search for "simulate" and enter "Ctrl+Shift+L"

45
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,380
Then add "Ctrl+R" to reverse the path direction.

46
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,120
and finally "Page down" for "stack down" and "Page up" for "stack up"

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,620
Let's have a closer look to the stack up and down functions.

48
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,680
Open the object panel.

49
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,040
It displays a full list of all layers, groups and objects in the document in it's "stacking order".

50
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,240
Remove the ignore symbol that we previously added and

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
move the objects so that they are overlapping each other.

52
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,220
If you use the raise and lower buttons on the first object,

53
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,880
you will see, how their stacking order is changing positions.

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,760
This doesn't work work if the objects are not overlapping each other.

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,060
Now use your newly created shortcut keys and see, that the stacking order is changing again.

56
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,200
The up and down buttons in the objects panel will do the same as your keyboard shortcuts.

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,760
The objects position will define the order from bottom to top

58
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,580
how your pattern is being stitched out and this makes it to be a main feature while carefully planing your design.

59
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,040
Path outlines will show you the direction of the path.

60
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,200
The path direction is important for all stitch types except for fill stitches.

61
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,120
It defines at which end of the stroke the stitching will begin.

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:19,620
In 'Preferences > Tools > Node' enable the following checkboxes

63
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,340
"show patch directions on outlines" and "show temporary outline for selected paths".

64
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:34,180
With objects selected press "N" to activate the node tool and enable "Show path outline".

65
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,640
You will see a red path surrounding the objects.

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,620
The spikes indicate the path direction.

67
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,020
You can use grids to align patterns properly.

68
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,420
To activate them open 'File > Document Properties' and switch to the "Grids" tab.

69
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:06,960
Click on New and change units to mm (this is the common unit used for stitch length etc.)

70
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,180
and set the x- and y-spacing to 1.

71
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,860
If you zoom out the major grid line will be displayed.

72
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:27,600
It defaults to 5, change it to 10, then you have 1 cm to be displayed.

73
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,000
Your objects will will snap to the grid edges by default.

74
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:45,060
You can change this by disabling snapping or disable "Snap to grids only".

75
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:59,420
If you want to temporarily hide the grid, hit # or change it through the menu: 'View > Page Grid'.

76
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,500
Also have a look at the panel "Align and Distribute" which you can find under 'Objects' in the menu.

77
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,140
Here you can find a lot of useful aligning methods.

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,420
It seems to be no fun to set up the same document properties over and over again.

79
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,220
You would rather like to open a new document and it has the size of your embroidery frame.

80
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Well, that is possible.

81
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,060
Once you organized everything as desired, simply save your file in your templates folder.

82
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Select the template folder path for your operating system from the description below.

83
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,980
You can now access your template through 'File > New from template'

84
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,980
On inkstitch.org you can even download a predefined template with various hoop sizes.

85
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial.

86
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,560
Now you are all set to start your creative work.

87
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,480
