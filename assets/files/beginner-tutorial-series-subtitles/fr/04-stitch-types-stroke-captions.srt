Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,640
In this part we are going to have a closer look which stitch types Ink/Stitch is able to perform.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,640
We will not explain the stitch types in general, but only how to create them in Ink/Stitch.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,100
Ink/Stitch stitch types can be roughly divided into three sections: stroke, satin and fill.

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,300
Here is a complete list, so you can quickly navigate to the stitch type you are interested in.

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,400
This is the tutorial about stroke type stitches.

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,140
Stroke stitches can be used for: outlines, line art embroidery or to add details into your design.

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,160
Zig-zag stitches are are easy to create.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,360
We recommend to use them only for straight lines, because they will not stitch nicely around edges.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,320
In most cases, you would prefer a satin column instead.

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
That said, let's see how they are done.

12
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,280
Hit "B" to enable the bezier curve tool and draw a simple path.

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,340
Open the "Fill and Stroke" settings and set the path width in the stroke style tab.

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,160
This will define the height of your zig-zag-line.

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,580
Go to 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params' to open the parameter dialogue.

16
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,140
"Satin stitch along path" has to be enabled in the Stroke tab.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,380
Set zig-zag-spacing to whatever you like it to be.

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,920
You can also define the number of repeats.

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,200
All other settings will not have any effect on zig-zag stitching.

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,460
Running stitches are created in a similiar way.

21
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,800
But this time you have to set the stroke style to a dashed line.

22
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,940
Any type of dashes will do the job and stroke width is irrelevant.

23
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Create a path and open the params dialogue.

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,720
"Satin stitch along path" has to be enabled in the Stroke tab.

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,360
Setting can be applied for "running stitch length"

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,620
and "repeats".

27
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,180
Bean stitch creates thicker threading through back and forth repetition of running stitches.

28
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,860
It works almost the same as running stitches,

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,340
but you have to set additionally the "bean stitch number of repeats".

30
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,120
A value of 1 would triple each stitch, because it goes forward, back and forward again.

31
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,580
A value of 2 would results in a quintupled stitch.

32
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:30,660
In manual stitch mode Ink/Stitch will use each node of a path as a needle penetration point, exactly as you placed them.

33
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,540
Create a path. Line style and width are irrelevant.

34
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,780
We recommend to display all nodes of the corresponding path as corners, since manual stitch will not respect bezier curves.

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Run "Params"

36
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,520
and enable "Manual stitch placement".

37
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,680
All other settings will have no effect in manual stitch mode.

38
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:17,380
Remember to also add tie-in or tie-off stitches, since they are not created automatically in manual stitch mode.

39
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,560
We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and got a small overview about all stroke stitch types Ink/Stitch is capable to perform.
