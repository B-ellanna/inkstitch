00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,080
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,920
In this part we are going to look into the lettering tool.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:22,920
In Ink/Stitch it is possible to write a multiline text, which will automatically be converted into an embroidery font.

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,660
Run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Lettering"

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,340
Being in a very early state the tool can handle only one font. This will change in a future release.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,340
Now enter your text.

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,500
You will see the simulator updating as you write.

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:53,540
With multiline text you might want Ink/Stitch to start stitching from the right in uneven line numbers.

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,960
Enable the option “Stitch lines of text back and forth” for this matter.

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,620
Click on "Apply and Quit"

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,940
Ink/Stitch will insert all paths necessary for your text.

12
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,480
You can modify it if you like or save it directly as an embroidery file.

13
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,800
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial and the lettering tool.
