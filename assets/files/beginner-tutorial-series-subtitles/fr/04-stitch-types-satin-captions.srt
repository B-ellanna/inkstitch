00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,860
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,200
In this part we are going to have a closer look which stitch types Ink/Stitch is able to perform.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,520
We will not explain the stitch types in general, but only how to create them in Ink/Stitch.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:30,400
Ink/Stitch stitch types can be roughly divided into three sections: stroke, satin and fill.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,800
Here is a complete list, so you can quickly navigate to the stitch type you are interested in.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,200
This is the tutorial about satin columns.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,580
Satin stitch is mostly used for borders, letters or small fill areas.

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:55,940
Ink/Stitch will draw zig-zags back and forth between two lines, while you can vary the thickness of the column as you like.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,120
There are various methods to create satin columns.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,860
We will first show you the very basic and manual way, before we simplify the process with the help from satin tools.

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,240
So let's create two paths

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,760
and combine them with 'Path > Combine' or 'Ctrl + K'.

13
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Next we open the params dialogue

14
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,840
and switch to the "satin column" tab, where we enable "Custom satin column".

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,660
In our example the simulator shows not what we expected.

16
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,720
This is what you get, when path directions aren't the same on both sides of the rails.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
Activate the node tool by pressing "N" and select your satin column.

18
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,600
If you followed our customize tutorial you will see red sparks indicating the path direction.

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,140
Select one node of one path and run "Path > Reverse" or use your custom shortcut key to reverse the path.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,500
If you run params again you will now see the correct satin column being animated.

21
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,580
You can influence the angle with help of the nodes.

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,900
But always keep in mind, that on both rails we need the same amount of nodes.

23
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,780
Otherwise you will receive an error message like this.

24
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,560
This is easy to achieve in a simple path like this.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,720
But what if you have a more complex shape and you really don't feel like counting nodes all day.

26
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,900
Well, Ink/Stitch has a solution for this. The "rung"-method.

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,240
With the  satin column selected activate the pencil tool by pressing "P".

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,254
Hold "shift" while you draw the rung.

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,920
Rungs have to cross both rails once.

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,940
These rungs will give Ink/Stitch all the information about the stitch angle and no counting of nodes is needed.

31
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:48,840
If you want the satin column to be a line of equal width, there is a very fast method to create a satin column.

32
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Create a path.

33
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,660
Make sure it is not a closed path, but has a start and an end.

34
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,220
Set the stroke width to whatever you like your satin column to be.

35
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,280
Then run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Satin Tools > Convert Line to Satin Column".

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
And that's it.

37
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,020
Sometimes you will need to break up your path into pieces.

38
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,640
This can be done manually, but if you want to keep your settings you can use a specific satin tool: "Cut Satin Column".

39
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,480
To break up your column manually, select two nodes,

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,580
one on each rail and click on

41
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,400
"Break path at selected nodes".

42
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:56,640
Now you have to seperate the paths by hitting "Ctrl + Shift + K" and recombine your sub-paths with "Ctrl + K".

43
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,600
Using the satin tools will require two steps.

44
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:18,760
First select your satin column and run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Commands > Attach commands to selected objects..."

45
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,980
and enable "Satin cut point" before you click on "Apply".

46
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,340
Move the symbol to the exact point where you want the satin column to split up.

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,220
It will split where the connector touches the rail.

48
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,400
Then run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Satin Tools > Cut Satin Column".

49
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,020
Please note, that in params you already need the satin column to be enabled for this to work.

50
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,440
"Flip Satin Column Rails" is a tool to help you plan your stitch path precisely.

51
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:25,160
A satin column which originally starts on the left rail and ends on the right, will start on the right rail and end on the left.

52
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,980
This might shorten connections between the previous and next stitch object.

53
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:44,800
Select the satin column and run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Satin Tools > Flip Satin Columns"

54
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,800
Planing the order and connections of stitch objects can be very time consuming.

55
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,560
Therefore Ink/Stitch comes with a tool that will take away a lot of this work.

56
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,860
"Auto-Route Satin Columns" will order your satin columns in logical stitching order.

57
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,180
It will create under-pathing and jump-stitches as necessary.

58
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Single satin columns might also be split up to avoid jump stitches.

59
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,920
Resulting satins will retain all of the parameters you had set on the original satins.

60
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,460
Select satin columns with all parameters set (underlay, etc.).

61
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:59,460
Run "Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Satin Tools > Auto-Route Satin Columns..."

62
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,060
Enable desired options and click apply.

63
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,020
You can even define a start and an end point for your ordered satin columns by

64
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,620
attaching "Auto-route satin stitch starting" and "ending position" commands.

65
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:03,060
If this went too fast for you, you might be interested into the visual commands tutorial.

66
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,340
Let's have a closer look into the params dialogue and what it offers for satin columns.

67
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,380
"Custom satin column" has to be enabled.

68
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,420
Satin stitches pull the fabric together, resulting in a column narrower than you draw in Inkscape.

69
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,400
With the "Pull compensation" setting you can expand the satin column.

70
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:40,640
You’ll have to experiment how much compensation you need for your combination of fabric, thread, and stabilizer.

71
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,940
Zig-zag spacing will define the density of your satin column.

72
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,420
Well, now we talked much about the satin column itself.

73
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,680
But a very important part is still missing, which is the underlay.

74
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,360
Ink/Stitch supports three kinds of underlay.

75
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,160
For wide columns or challenging fabrics, you can even use all three underlay types together.

76
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,840
This is a row of running stitch down the center of the column and back.

77
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,140
This may be all you need for thin satin columns.

78
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,100
You can also use it as a base for more elaborate underlay.

79
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,760
This is a row of running stitch up one side of the column and back down the other.

80
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:44,080
The rows are set in from the edge of the column by the amount you specify.

81
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,680
For small or medium width satin, this may serve well enough by itself.

82
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:05,280
This is essentially a lower-density satin stitch sewn to the end of the column and back to the start.

83
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,460
The biggest purpose for E-stitch is a simple but strong cover stitch for applique items.

84
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,220
Mainly for baby cloths as their skin tends to be more sensitive.

85
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,120
E-stitch is created just as a satin column.

86
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,740
But in the params dialogue enable the E-stitch option and increase the zig-zag spacing.

87
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Underlay is not needed for this stitch type.

88
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,620
If the points are facing the wrong way, just use the “flip satin column rails” tool as described before.

89
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,360
We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and got an overview about satin stitch types.
