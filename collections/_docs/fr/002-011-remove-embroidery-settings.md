Use this function to remove the information Ink/Stitch has stored in your document.
This can be especially useful if you copy and paste objects from an embroidery design into another document.

The extensions will remove embroidery settings from your entire design or from selected objects:
* select objects
  (skip this step if you want to clear all embroidery information)
* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Remove embroidery settings...`
* Select one or all of the given options and click apply
