## Issues during Installation

### I have downloaded and unzipped the [latest release](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/releases/latest). Where do I put it?

In Inkscape open: `Edit > Preferences > System` and check the paths for extensions.

You should preferably install in **USER EXTENSIONS**, since this will make it easier to update later.

If you have any diacritics in your username, try the **INKSCAPE EXTENSIONS** path if you are having trouble running Ink/Stitch.

### My Ink/Stitch dosen't run!

*   **Confirm installation path**<br>
    Check if files were possibly extracted into a *sub-directory*.
    You should see a lot of files starting with "inkstitch" **directly** inside the extension folder, beside of one folder called "inkstitch".

*   **Windows Antivirus Software**<br>
    This is more prone to happen in Windows, since the python is packed into a executable there are reports of anti-virus-software using heuristics
    that mark the extension as a false positive. The solution in this cases is to add the Ink/Stitch extension folder to the exception list on the
    av program reinstall the extension and try again.

    If your antivirus software deleted files, you will receive an error message like this:
    ```
    Tried to launch: inkstitch\bin\inkstitch
    Arguments: ['inkstitch\bin\inkstitch', '--id=XXX', '--extension=XXX', 'C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Temp\ink_ext_XXXXXX.svgXXXXX']
    Debugging information:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "inkstitch.py", line 35, in <module>
        extension = subprocess.Popen(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
      File "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\lib\python2.7/subprocess.py", line 325, in __init__
        errread, errwrite)
      File "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\lib\python2.7/subprocess.py", line 575, in _execute_child
        startupinfo)
    WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
    ```

### I installed Ink/Stitch but the menu is greyed out (disabled)

This is often the case, if the wrong Ink/Stitch version has been installed.
Please verify if you have downloaded the correct Ink/Stitch version for your operating system.

### I installed Ink/Stitch in my native language, but the dialogue windows are displayed in English!

First, it is possible, that not all strings have been translated. This is indicated by **some strings of text beeing in English and others in your native language**.
If you like to complete the translation, have a look at our [description for translators](/developers/localize/).

Then, we have to distinguish between the Extension menu in Inkscape and the dialogue windows.
The selection of the ZIP file causes only the Extension menu to be in a certain language.
The dialgoue windows are build differently. They will use the language of your operating system.
If Ink/Stitch is uncertain, which language to support, it will fallback on English.
You can tell Inkscape explicitly to use your native language as follows:
  * Go to Edit > Preferences > Interface (Ctrl + Shift + P)
  * Set your language
  * Restart Inkscape

## Using Ink/Stitch

### Ink/Stitch is creating zig-zag lines instead of running stitch

![Running Stitch Dashes](/assets/images/docs/running-stitch-dashes.jpg){: .align-right style="padding: 5px"}
Make sure you follow the [running stitch instructions](/docs/stitches/running-stitch/).

You are most likely using a continuous stroke instead of a dashed stroke.

### Guideline Origin isn't working!

The guideline method for setting the origin (0,0) is **deprecated**.

Use [**visual commands**](/docs/commands) instead:
* Go to `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Commands > Add Commands â€¦` and choose `Origin`
* Place the symbol ![origin](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-origin.jpg) where you like the origin to be.
