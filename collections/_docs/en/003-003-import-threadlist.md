In Ink/Stitch you can import threadlists which then will be applied to the color blocks of your design. Although it might be able to recognize some unkown threadlist types (txt only), it is best at reading Ink/Stitch specific color charts.

### Usage
Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Import Threadlist ...` to apply a threadlist exported by Ink/Stitch.

If you want to import any other threadlist from a txt-file, choose the option "Import other threadlist" and pick a threadlist from the dropdown menu before clicking on apply.

**Tipp:** [Install Add-Ons for Ink/Stitch](/docs/addons/) to have more threadlists available.
